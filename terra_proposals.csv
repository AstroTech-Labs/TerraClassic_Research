After its launch in June of 2019, it has seen tremendous growth by partnering with major commerce players in Korea such as TMON (general e-Commerce), Yanolja (hospitality and leisure), and CU (#1 convenience store with over 14000 stores across Korea). Some key metrics for the project are as follows: 1M+ users accumulated in less than a year, $400M in expected annual transactions (run-rate), integrations with 12+ major commerce players in Korea with many more to come. Chai's transaction volumes are reflected on the Terra blockchain, meaning that The transaction volumes of the Chai payment application are correlated with Terra transaction volumes.
Chai utilizes seigniorage-funded discounts to offer deals for customers who choose Chai at merchant checkout. This creates a virtuous cycle where (1) users select Chai at a merchant's checkout page (2) Chai/Terra tx volume increases which in turn increases Terra money supply (seigniorage creation) (3) seigniorage is allocated to Chai which then uses it as a budget for providing promotion discounts (4) Users are incentivized to use Chai at checkout due to seigniorage-driven promotional schemes.

- BLOCK research team, Prince of Songkla University, Phuket campus
- Co-founder of Sabai (We run the StakeSabai Terra node.)

I'm proposing to add TerraTHB stablecoin. 

Crypto communities in Thailand have been excited about Terra and projects on Terra (Mirror, especially).

THB is also #15 by marketcap on https://fiatmarketcap.com/. This is only two spots below CHF and four spots above SGD. Both CHF and SGD are already on Terra.

If TerraTHB is added, Thai users will receive the following benefits:
- An access to a decentralized, THB stablecoin
- Ability to include THB into a risk-diversified investment portfolio with other fiat currencies

Non-Thai users will receive the following benefits:
- An exposure to a strong currency. THB has been making a strong gain against most currencies in the last 5 years. https://www.tradingview.com/x/EDyG9sWG/
- A potential exposure to a developing-country’s economy in SEA. While SGD is already on Terra, but SG is a developed country. An exposure to Thai economy could help diversify investment in this region.
- Another FX currency to trade on Terra.

- Create a high-velocity pool of capital to take advantage of opportunities within Terra.
- Establish 3rd parties to verify quality and keep initiatives accountable to high-leverage use of community resources.
- Increase overall metabolism and rate of innovation within the Terra Ecosystem.

Rapid grants will be deployed to accelerate teams the Terra Ecosystem Committees believed to be essential to ecosystem development and the overall health of the Terra ecosystem. Thus, we will move fast to secure opportunities within the ecosystem.

- Rapid Grants pool fund to be seeded with an initial 300K LUNA to provide funding for teams that would benefit the ecosystem via rapid funding. For example, upcoming hackathons/sponsorships, and teams that the Committee would like to expose to the Terra Ecosystem heavily.
- The initial funding will be for Q3 and Q4 of 2021 encompassing August 1 (or whenever proposal passes, whatever happenss earlier) to December 31st, 2021.
- In this format, funding decisions are to be made within 72 hours of the formal submission of a proposal. This is opposed to the potential 4-week period of a proposal review by TFL as well as the two-week on-chain vote period, which provides flexibility for teams to maintain high shipping velocity. Teams will still be required to submit all necessary proposals and milestone documentation. All funding will be auditable on-chain. However, select teams will be eligible for distribution via a rapid grant.
- The Terra Ecosystem Committee will vote on all Rapid Grants and a simple majority will be needed to approve a Rapid Grant. Rapid Grants are to be recorded in public via the public Terra Ecosystem page for community records.
- Rapid Grants bypass the on-chain vote and instead delegates authority to internal TFL members to issue grants.
- The Rapid Grants pool will also be used to fund expenses related to the program including Hackathon development, sponsorships, and other community initiatives (CosmWasm course development, etc), creation of podcasts, institutional reports, conferences, etc. to increase overall developer supply.

Community Pool Grants are designed to allow teams to make proper use of our community pool by setting actionable milestones to be audited by both the community and Terra Ecosystem Committee members. Through this process, we aim to support teams in developing and adhering to actionable milestones that deliver value to the Terra ecosystem.

Grant Sizes
- $1k to $30k - grant size for teams that are developing within the Terra Ecosystem that have a new concept they are attempting to work on. All teams that have never received community pool funds will be defaulted into this grant size unless all team members have previously (1) accepted funds from the Community Pool and (2) successfully implemented all milestones with success.
- $30k to $100k - only available as follow-on funding to teams that have met initial milestones and have previously successfully executed on a smaller grant size.

Special grants mechanisms reserved to allow for TFL sponsored special projects to be capitalized with community fund resources. For example, stablecoin distribution initiatives initiated by TFL employees: https://agora.terra.money/t/bringing-terra-stablecoins-to-solana/1537/22 2

The year 1 ‘genesis’ LunaFest will be hosted at a palatial manor house in the stunning English countryside, with a focus on live music, world class DJ’s, cutting edge entertainment and knowledge-sharing from global blockchain industry experts. 

LunaFest will become the world’s first Cryptocurrency festival, where the preferred currency will be UST with discounts, giveaways and promotions as a reward. 

To achieve all this we’ve gathered a rockstar team of committed Lunatics from around the community, who are ready to deliver an event that will - literally - bring Luna to the world and change how festivals and live music are delivered, forever. 

We will build LunaFest to become a key event in the global crypto calendar, known as a playground for gathering like minds, sharing ideas, having fun and, most importantly, helping to onboard non-natives and expand the Terra ecosystem. 

This is ‘your’ festival and we need your help to do this, so let’s make it happen together…!

We are requesting 3 million UST to accelerate the development of the TIX platform. TIX will allow the community to have direct access to the trillion-dollar a year live events industry; this does not include metaverse events that TIX will also be building in functionality for. This means that the general public will begin accessing Terra through TIX, thereby bringing in new users and new money to the ecosystem.

Our aim is to open source our smart contract code once the project completes V2 on our roadmap. This project does not exist without the inspiration and good will of other open source projects within the Terra community. As such, we want to contribute and help inspire future projects to utilize their ingenuity, skillsets, and passion to build other incredible projects on Terra, solve vital world problems, and drive even more UST demand and adoption.

Why Community Funding?
This community funding will allow us to accelerate the development of TIX without taking a substantial amount of private funding in order to implement all of the core functionality. We can then dedicate the maximum number of resources to developing game-breaking technology that will deliver the most value to our ecosystem and its users.

Should the community approve this funding, we will be able to allocate tokens that would have been used to raise from VCs, back to the community in the form of Luna staker airdrops and community engagement rewards.",Community Funding Proposal: Accelerate TIX Protocol Development,terra1meazymyzx2z2uxrawlr7r5e0l69f3z035r6ptc,REJECTED,2022-03-02 03:21:43.900000+00:00,2022-03-16 03:21:43.900000+00:00,2022-03-02 03:21:43.900000+00:00,2022-03-09 03:21:43.900000+00:00,"[{""amount"":""50000000"",""denom"":""uluna""}]",13885112.331918,81102835.158182,0.0,68788010.958295

With the integration, users can now trade maximum returns on Terra-based assets executed by OpenOcean Atlantic, our second version, which provides an algorithm optimized for maximum returns that cannot be found anywhere else.

We would like to propose a trading competition on OpenOcean in partnership with Terra and leading Terra projects.

This will allow our 400,000 active user base to be introduced to the Terra ecosystem and Terra-based assets - increasing awareness and bringing on more users to Terra.

For this, we would like to ask the Terra community for 20kUSD worth of LUNA to allocate for campaign rewards.",Community Funding Proposal for DEX Aggregator - OpenOcean Partnership Campaign,terra1c3xk35wfncnt6px5pluyjrr7jw9jt43dg98tdv,PASSED,2022-03-16 07:23:48.350000+00:00,2022-03-30 07:23:48.350000+00:00,2022-03-16 07:24:20.739000+00:00,2022-03-23 07:24:20.739000+00:00,"[{""amount"":""50000000"",""denom"":""uluna""}]",164417909.269031,1185190.622123,12.375408,13435649.395505

No word is better than Action, For our Creator is movement and rest. Do not believe the worst, for it has already passed for those who did not notice. I believe in this gem and this will only contribute to improving what needs to be revised. Nothing is lost. Heroes appear exactly when needed, just like angels....
Everything here will be even stronger and for cowards and traitors simply, contempt is yours....
Life is made of steps, no one was born talking or walking. This is all part of growing up, and what I see here is a child who is growing strong and consistently. The protocol is excellent, there is nothing to fear.... Just another victory, and this one, with a capital V. So, let's fight with aggression where it's necessary, agility where it's slow and prudence where it's unbalanced and panicked. This too shall pass!
Big hug from Brazil because you will see that a son of yours does not run away from the fight!
Everything is happening according to the will of God.
Believe me, this too shall pass.

Mint and Burn process.
Don't give up on UST, the path is correct, just one correction and everything will be restored.

shall we recap, calmly?
The bottom of the river is better visible when the water calms down....
What happens when creating a UST or LUNA?

1) Why did it lose value? disregard overselling...
2) How is the real value of the UST physically composed and guaranteed? 1 UST:USD 1 in Bank?
3) What about Gold?

My suggestion is to keep LUNA and create GLUNA...
When a new UST is created, a part of the GLUNA and LUNA must be used for BALLAST.
LUNA would continue operating from the ""brokers"" ecosystem, but GLUNA would not, it would only be internal UST Support,
So we would have 2 tokens supporting the UST not just one
This last one in pure gold, hence GLUNA.
In the process of mint a UST, a part of LUNA and a part of GLUNA would be used.
So the next UST would be created from this 2 tokens
UST backed by GLUNA 50-70% (depending on swing) LUNA 20-50%
As more UST or LUNA is purchased, a portion of GLUNA would go into the recipe to strengthen our blessed DOllar.

So you can keep what already exists and strengthen the new UST generated through business normally.... Life that goes on...

The biggest problem is when you create a UST based only on LUNA, you are subject to all kinds of market mess.
The GLUNA would be an internal currency, fully backed by gold.
Thus, at the time of minting 1 UST, it would use part LUNA and part GLUNA. GLUNA cannot be traded outside the ecosystem and must have its price and quantity based on GOLD.
At the time of minting, UST must have its largest share in the value of the gold price. Gold always beats the dollar, probably, our dollar UST, in this way, it will always be above or equal to 1 dollar if new UST is generated.
As the days go by, the UST will regain its value and everything will get even better.

Luna is heavily compromised and has a too low price, which could create security problems with direct attacks on governance, which is why Do Kwon's choice to create a fork makes sense, and it is the right way to go, but it is not enough. these steps will also have to be taken to ensure the safety that LUNA and UST lacked.
1. Take a snapshot of the values ​​of the various portfolios before the attack and create 2 classes of NFT:
Holders of NFT LUNA
NFT UST holders
which will be customized with the value of the individual portfolios of the owners of the LUNA at the value before the collapse.
This will allow, as soon as activated, to receive an Airdrop of the new currency (eg “LUNA2” and “UST2”) which will have a market value equal to the date of the snapshot.
Unfortunately this will not be enough because, if we do not solve the famous ""death spiral"", nothing prevents it from happening again.
This collapse has shown how currently relatively large volumes can undermine UST's PEG and even more how rapid movements destabilize its anchoring.
2. Study an algorithm that slows down or prevents instant withdrawals above a certain threshold (the threshold will be calculated based on how long it will take to return to the peg if a certain order or X number of orders were executed simultaneously)

This would prevent those who want to manipulate the value of UST2 from instantly moving capital.
The threshold will only be set to protect the ecosystem and not prevent whales from entering, so it will be well calibrated.
3. Instead of using only LUNA to maintain the PEG, it is possible to create not pools, but independent tanks of different redistributed coins which will intervene alternately to stabilize both LUNA2 and UST2 for example as follows: 40% BTC 25% LUNA 15% USDT / USTC /… 20% from the coins of the various CEXs who want to collaborate in the creation of the first large decentralized currency.
4. the TERRA Chain should not die at the moment as well as LUNA and UST, but they could become an experimental blockchain platform designed to provide a massively interoperable and scalable framework for developers (ex. Kusama for Polkadot).
LUNA could even become the adoption currency of future EARTH world metaverses and Games.

1、启动新公链LUNA2 ICO。
2、ICO总量为10亿枚（可调整），ICO时间定于本提案生效后的第30天。
3、ICO可接受Token为usdt、usdc、busd、dai、ust、luna
4、Luna2总量分为空投、公募、社区发展三部分，空投部分补偿给ust第二次脱锚时的LUNA持有者（包含CEXers），公募部分可接受usdt、usdc、busd、dai、ust、luna等Token，以上token按照美元价值计算公募额。usdt、usdc、busd、dai、ust按照1美元计算美元价值，luna按照ICO结束时币价*110%计算美元价值。
5、社区发展部份锁定LUNA2总量的10%。
6、空投和公募的部分占据LUNA2总量的90%，比例按照ust第二次脱锚时的LUNA市值与ICO结束时LUNA市值比例分配。
7、ICO公募结束后ust不再享有LUNA市值的保障，原Terra链继续运行，LUNA币更名为LunaMeMe。
8、Terra链上的BTC等保障资金将仅支持LUNA2，不用做LUNAMeMe的市值保障。
9、LUNA2保有原名称LUNA
提案解释：
本提案把原来对立的新、旧LUNA和ust的持有者的利益统一起来，统一后的社区共识将空前强大，本提案有可能将本次危机化为新LUNA发展的大机遇。

- get 1% to 10 % taxes on luna transfert and burn it 
- use half of the reserve of the LFG to buy and burn
- borrow or get investors and convince them to buy and burn half (Binance team could join)
how is that will work?
After separating Ust of Luna we have to set a goal limit of supply to 300 million luna, the volume by hour in binance is between 300billion and 1.4 trillion luna, if we burn 10% of it, the 6.9 trillion luna will decrease each hour by 30 billion upto 140 billion or more, we can decrease the tax rate after until we reach the goal and then stop it.
Burning the half of the reserve and getting investors and borrowers to do so will enhance the trust.

I propose that instead of the LFG trying to compensate one group of our community they should help us all. 
Why and how is this possible. 

Firstly why? 
What happened impacted everyone. The same event that caused UST to lose peg also caused $LUNA value to crash. So it makes zero sense to only compensate one group. 
Secondly this creates division. $LUNA stakers are committed community members. If only UST holders are compensated this creates a THEM and US situation. Not good for a rebuild. Not good for our community.

How? How is everyone looked after in this situation?

Firstly the airdrop of new tokens must be EQUAL. 

20% - $LUNA stakers (At the time of de peg) *EXCLUDING LFG staked $LUNA.  
20% - $UST holders (On the Terra network, just prior to depeg)
20% - bLUNA holders (Just prior to depeg) 
20% $LUNA holders (At the time of depeg, On the terra network)
15% - Community fund/developer fund 
5% - $UST/$LUNA holders on the Terra network at this time 

Now everyone has an equal share they need a reason to stay. This is where high staking rewards come in. 
Are many people willing to stake and therefore secure the new network after what happened? Probably not. 
BUT if the staking rewards are high (Over 100% APR) then it gives people a reason to stake, an opportunity to rebuild their losses over time. 
On top of this, high staking rewards attracts new users therefore new buyers, driving price of the new token. 
It benefits Everyone. Not just one group. 

Building a stronger community and increasing the chance of Everyone getting back what they lost. 

Thank you

1.  Institute a peg of UST to 1 USD in Terraswap, allowing the swapping of UST for any coin in Terraswap at a 1USD value.  This will incentivize people to purchase UST in outside exchanges, and thus push up the price.  Terraswap users can then transfer those coins to outside exchanges to sell, and repurchase more UST.
2.  Increase the fee paid in Terraswap by 100x as long as the price of UST on the open market is below $0.999
3.  Require fees to be paid in LUNA, as long as the price of UST on the open market is below $0.999
4.  Burn all fees paid on Terraswap and Astroport as long as the price of UST on the open market is below $0.999
5.  Burn all UST and LUNA swapped in Terraswap or Astroport, thus reducing the supply, as long as the price of UST on the open market is below $0.999

This will help push the UST peg back toward 1 USD while helping to compensate previous supporters for their losses in the crash.  In doing this, the supply of LUNA and UST will be reduced drastically as long as the value of UST remains below $.999

A (non linear) tiered system of incentives should be put in place with these principles: the more you burn and the earlier you burn your Lunas, the more and the earlier you will get from a form of future reward, with a more or less favorable vesting period.
When possible, refund the small and medium wallets even if some of them would be double rewarded because they sold their Lunas and UST earlier, putting more fire for the death sipiral. This double reward as a compensation for their suffering. 
I hope the stories about suicides are not true, otherwise the people who provoke this death spiral intentionaly to profit from, would get a very strong punition now or in the future (the law of the nature, KARMA) as millions of people are affected. 
Now, in burning lunas, they could do a very good action by being the WHALE BURNERS (and not being burned themselves later or now in some kind of hell).

First of all, the transfer of 25012 BTC on May 9, 2022, with a value of 842 million USD. Then a series of transfers on May 9, 2022, totaling 70752 BTC and valued at 2,380 billion USD.

Given the off-chain nature of these transactions and their amount, we strongly recommend the LFG to communicate their purpose and intent.

We would suggest LFG publish in detail the actions that have been taken to maintain the UST peg, as well as the reports of the transactions that have been made on the exchanges. Given the circumstances and the amount involved, the highest level of transparency is required for the sake of the project and its community.

As indicated.

Gold Benefits: Best profitability in history against any currency, we have PAXG and BTG available if you don't want to keep physical gold. But make contracts with companies that have real ballast. Another benefit is liquidity, it is a commodity accepted even in the other world, according to the pharaohs' belief... Lol.
Benefits of BTC: Future store of value for the next 150 years, but for now it suffers a lot of manipulation by the retards.

So, we would look like this: UST 2.0 and keep the current structure.
UST 2.0 Composition:
1) GLUNA (60%) Dollar (30%) BTC (10% when it has more value, can be used with greater weight in the UST currency basket)
2) This dollar must be fully audited, having its total at 1:10. In other words, we would have 10% guarantee for each UST 2.0

1. Buyback all circulating LUNA at fixed price (0.0016 UST) and issue 6.91 T � 0.0016 = 11.056 bn UST (if all LUNA tokens offered for buyback). Buyback to be operational for 15 days after acceptance of this proposal.
2. After the end of buyback period, burn all LUNA tokens.
3. Issue new LUNA2 tokens to holders before the de-peg on pro-rata basis. No. of new LUNA2 tokens to be double that of circulating supply of UST after the buyback.
4. Peg UST to USD in 20:1 ratio and lock half of LUNA2 tokens for an unspecified period till the time mkt cap of LUNA2 on the strength of its DeFi protocol reaches 5 times the mkt cap of UST and stays so for atleast 3 months continuously. The locked LUNA2 token can be used by LFG to maintain the peg.
5. Thereafter restart the UST-LUNA2 pegging algorithm and tweak the algorithm to allow automatic suspension of its operation on certain indications & reversion to collatarized model (LUNA2 being the collateral) till indications revert to normal. Sufficient LUNA should also be issued to LFG on the start of UST-LUNA2 peg to manage collateralization in times of distress.

The ecosystem's success was mainly due to the UST concept, which in my point of view was brilliant. Ironically, it was also the apparent reason for the crash.

Suggestion: Let's focus where we really should, recover the price of the UST and its dignity, the LUNA with its market price and a backing in the UST 2.0 (considering gold, dollar and BTC in this basket) Once that is done, I guarantee that we will turn around over.

-initiation of proposal 1623 and the creation of a new Terra Chain can only be started if the Luna token supply has been reduced to a level of at least 2 trillion tokens. 
-As a large part of the community has lost their trust, also professional external advisors must be consulted in the rebuilding and burning of Luna. CZ from Binance should at least  be requested to help, although it is ultimately his choice to help or not.

If more LUNA coins are being shorted then are in supply at exchanges, if we pull our coins off to wallets (which you need to do anyway to get the airdrop), then it will cause a huge short squeeze as exchanges will force liquidations of short positions to fulfill coin withdrawals.

So I am asking the community to pull our coins off of exchanges now so we can finally get true price discovery and destroy the shorters instead of rolling over and letting them win and destroy LUNA.

https://agora.terra.money/t/new-ust-lunac-revival-plan-leadership-bid/14069?u=deathstar_daddy

I am proposing a solid plan to fix, and revive LUNA Classic and UST, as well as to further build and enhance the ecosystem.

I am further proposing a leadership change. I am inserting myself to lead LUNA Classic and UST. I am doing this as Do Kwon & TerraLabs will obviously be busy with the new LUNA coin ecosystem they are building from the fork.

However with that said, I am very hopeful to retain both Do Kwon and TerraLabs in some new form of a Partnership. They will not be leading our ecosystem containg LUNA Classic, or UST, but by maintaing a small ownership stake, and or other form of investment in NEWCO. As Do Kwon and his team are far more knowledgeable on our ecosystem they anyone, they would be a strong asset to Newco.

I myself, along with a New Team will lead Newco along with the ecosystem containing Classic and UST moving forward with the plan laid out on the link above. While market conditions may require us to deviate from it slightly, the core plan will not be changed. At least not wothout a vote.

This or something like this has the following benefits:

(1) Takes a lot of supply out of circulation 
(2) Provides a clear and fair transmission mechanism for LUNAC holders to acquire LUNA
(3) Gives some predictable value to LUNAC while LUNA rolls out
(4) Reduces sell pressure of new LUNA 
(5) Creates a predictable path to reducing LUNAC supply

2- Avoid the Fork, and make a ""big chain update"" DELETING  the""pair sistem"" also you can apply a ""2 years cliff"" to the ""new holders"" (speculators) (just like the new plan of FORKING LUNA ) eg : if in some  (NEW/ POST ATTACK) wallet are +300.000 $LUNA that wallet WILL be have  is founds frezzed (20% unlocked at the ""new update"" 70% vested over 2 years thereafter with 6 month cliff and 5% deliver to the cominity pool and 5% ininvesteament to anchor).

3-Make the  FORK and delegate the ""recoverý plan"" of ""Classic Luna"" to CZ/Binance (this mabye required a new proposal wiht only YES OR NO option)

ps: in EVERY OPTION you can apply the ""freez speculators plan"" (this is more than just/ fair with the pre attak holders)..beside you can incentivate that ""new whales"" to invest they LUNAS in a long term project wiht a jucy % in gains

What was so strange about this meeting wasn't that it capped off a spending spree -- where the Luna Foundation Guard bought BTC with inflated UST and LUNA assets -- it was that it directly preceded the dissolution of both arms of Terraform Labs Corporation in Korea, which happened ON THE SAME DAY OF KWON'S MEETING WITH TERRA SHAREHOLDERS. I first learned about this in an article published by Coindesk, but later confirmed it in a report by the South Korean newspaper Korea JoongAng Daily -- which made the claim after reviewing Supreme Court documents regarding the dissolution.


Besides defending the American investors who held LUNA & UST, I felt it was important to honor the 280,000 Korean investors in the Terra platform who have lost in excess of $40 billion USD on a project that was so clearly flawed from the beginning. Like many other LUNAtics, I guess I got carried away with the project and decided to overlook the red flags that are so visible now. All things stated, it is important for you to abandon this project immediately before you lose any more money. Korean police have launched an investigation against a Luna Foundation Guard employee who is said to have embezzled assets once the precipitous decline of LUNA and UST began. Terra is dead, and Do Kwon should be investigated for defrauding millions of people around the world -- like you and me. You have been warned.

Once ust repegs we will continue the minting process for luna classic and ust. Then dropping the burn rate to 1% and the increasing the reserves to 1.5% on tax trades to ensure stability, 1% used in helping luna 2.0 have greater staking rewards. eventually I would like to see a permanent small burn even as low as 0.01% for luna classic, 1.49% going in reserves with 2% of the tax going directly into supporting luna 2.0 and offer greater rewards to everyone staking and then that way we can turn the greatest of failures into the biggest successes and ensure lunas twin sister with a great future.","Luna 2.0, Luna Classic, Ust + Minting.

710,2044,/cosmos.gov.v1beta1.TextProposal,Saving Terra Luna and cryptocurrencies,"To all of us who believe and invest in this project we must not settle for something that could be unfair. That position could be wrong because here we talk about a possible scam, even technical negligence of the project, losing money in a bad investment is understood that it is necessary to accept it but this case is unique and it is not to keep their arms crossed by accepting that they remain with Your money or simply assuming the error that does not correspond to you. I have lost money with bad investments but I repeat this case is unique and gives to talk much more during the time, even there is possible that there is fair compensation or fair resolution so that we can move forward with the project.

We are talking about a coin that looked unbeatable, located in the first places, not a common cryptocurrency that you could buy to try luck .. That is what I want to make clear.

 If you return what you invested or transfer it to you in another currency but with the value of our investment it would be the most fair.

We are talking about the future of cryptocurrencies, Luna will strongly affect if there is no fair solution that allows people to invest without distrust.

We must be responsible in these types of situations and that there are no way to drift, trust is what this ecosystem would work bireitely.

I worry about affected and how they will be compensated, that is what anyone who wants to invest in cryptos would look before. I repeat trust is what makes this ecosystem work.

It is possible to buy back and burn for cheap and for UST holders to recover at least 0.60$ per USD***

https://agora.terra.money/t/proposal-a-financially-viable-lunc-proposal/42722

======================================================

1. Allow UST holders to recover at least 0.60$ per UST

2. Restore network governance

3. After the buy back and burn we go back to a 2B supply of LUNC tokens only - no more USTs

4. We need to buy tokens back and burn them before doing anything else otherwise the network is not safe to use: https://medium.com/tgradefinance/when-the-tide-goes-out-we-see-who-is-wearing-a-swimming-costume-3ebd5f4d6127

5. Without the buy back, Luna Classic will simply be a pump and d_mp token as no builder will want to join since it will be possible to steal assets from the network. So no DEFi, no pools, no borrow lending, no NFTs etc. It is a pitty because there are many Apps readily available to use.

6. After the price reaches 30$ UST holders get 200M LUNC token for a total value of 6B$

7. After the price reaches 30$ UST whales get 200M LUNC token for a total value of 6B$

8. Main advantage of using options is that it lowers the cost of the buy back: At current market price it would cost around 650M to buy all the supply. But then as you buy price will increase so really cost of buy back will be more in the Billions USD. With options, we're buying back at 6B$ but we only need 130M$ today: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)

9. We could simply say UST holders get 200M LUNC tokens unlocking when price hits 30$. But with options they could sell before, if someone is willing to buy the options, some UST holders might be happy to sell and move on. With locked tokens..you're locked

10. How we redistribute the new supply (600M tokens) is up to the community

11. Works with other burns in place (from exchange fees etc.)

another thing is for the official terra team to share on all social media the official burning address. this will help stop the scams.
this is a working process please fill free to share your ideas, this proposal was made because we as a community ear the community and proposal 2975 was with a significant tax, so these numbers are the numbers that the community wants 1.2%. together we can do this please vote

Change the Governance system to be 75% Delegators & 25% Token Holders.

0.4% Gets Burned 
0.4% USTC Asset fund
0.2% Rebuild & Development Fund 
0.1% Fund set up to help pre attack holders. 

Re-Enable Staking. It's important to start, to help rebuild trust, however work needs to be done to fix the code & implement safeguards to prevent attacks.

1) Stop minting new LUNC tokens

2)Put some transaction tax (various ratios at different stages) and use this tax to buyback and burn LUNC till it reduces to 1B or less.

3) Terra team can come up with some workable solution which probably community cannot see due to complex technicalities.

4) Pegged UST again to LUNC if that's work after reducing LUNC to certain level or de-pegged it completely if team feels that won't work.

6) If terra team is not interested to pursue or work on LUNC then give this project back to community and make it as DAO. Let people decide (Please prove it that this project is run by South Korea not by North Korea)

We feel that community is divided into two groups, some in support of LUNA v2 and majority in favour of LUNC.

I think the design of the entire Terra Classic is that USTC and LUNC are symbiotic, and the root cause of all this is the decoupling of USTC, and now we just need to do everything we can to make USTC re-pegged to 1 dollar, then USTC and LUNC can start flying again.
At present, the price of USTC is 0.012U, the total amount is about 10.2 billion, and the market value is 122 million US dollars. And there are still 313 Bitcoins, 39914 BNBs, 1973554 AVAXs, and 1847079725 USTCs in LFG's reserves. I calculated that the value of the reserves is about $67900000. This value is excluding USTC.
Can we take a snapshot of the USTC holdings and issue a coin with USTC 1:1 AUSTC (the name is written casually). We only have $67,900,000 in circulation, and the rest is frozen, so that our Thai zipper can operate normally and generate profits, and then a part of the profits goes into LFG's reserves to continue to support the peg, and we unfreeze it every month or every day as the profit grows , so we can have hope.","This is a plan to revitalize the USTC and revive the LUNC, please discuss the community friends",0,REJECTED,2022-06-08 08:14:34.919000+00:00,2022-06-22 08:14:34.919000+00:00,2022-06-08 08:14:34.919000+00:00,2022-06-15 08:14:34.919000+00:00,"[{""amount"":""50000000"",""denom"":""uluna""}]",20023.901099,0.0,0.0,0.0

https://classic-agora.terra.money/t/burn-mechanism-on-transactions-1-2/43759

https://station.terra.money/proposal/3568

My proposal is the following:

0.01% burn Luna Clasic in all transactions of the entire terra ecosystem until arriving 5.000.000.00

Voting of equal conditions of the entire community of Luna. Neither vote weighs more than the other.

All validators will have a vote equal to the community.

Example:

If there are 100 validators, they will agree themselves to decide their vote. Thus it weighs the same as that of the community.

Luna Clasic will be used as a test engine to implement new projects to the new Terra ecosystem.

Remove the UST from Luna Classic.

Have a backup wallet of any cryptocurrency or stablecoin in case of disaster.

The wallet or wallets will be held by the validators as they have made the effort to rebuild the project.

This wallet will be monitored so that the holders can see it on any movement.

In case of any movement that has not been asked or reported, the validator will be expelled.

The validators will have a donation from the community for the effort they would make monthly.

The validators will agree on what cryptocurrency they will receive for their efforts. This vote will be published on terrastation monthly.

Since there was this disaster. The community and the validators must take control of the project.

In summary:

-Decentralization.

-Vote equally for everyone.

-Remove UST completely.

-Verification of any Lunc token vulnerability.

-Wallet or Wallets de backup

-Reward for validators

One of the goals of our project is entertaining game content in the RPG genre, as well as burning LUNC, which will be an in-game currency. The concept of introducing LUNC into our game:
In-game purchases will be made for LUNC, 70 percent of which after the transaction will be collected for a single wallet aimed at burning, which will help improve the state of the token. 25 percent is directed towards supporting the continued economy of the game and rewarding users for completing daily tasks, tournaments, and completing PvE content. 5 percent will be kept by the developers of the game. An analysis of the gaming market shows that the circle of users who are interested in investing their resources in the gaming process is growing every year, but at the same time, not a single game was launched on the Terra network despite the growing interest in the industry. In this way, it will be possible to expand the community's ability to burn and at the same time generate more interest in the ecosystem.
To date, we have developed an NFT collection that will be the first step towards the implementation of the game. Our collection was developed on the Ethereum blockchain but not so long ago we learned that you are launching your own NFT marketplace on the Terra network.

As an example as quoted by CZ from Binance, they want to do this but are not sure about their fee.

Dear people, we must not forget the exchanges, the big and
smaller exchanges actually earn a reward for applying the burn tax, if they lose nothing but gain from the burn tax, I think all exchanges will immediately apply the burn tax.

maybe 1% burn and 0.2% to the exchanges, I don't know but the exchanges want clarity on that, they are a company and want to make profits, like all of us ;-)

Or perhaps those who are in a position to consult with larger exchanges can try to negotiate an agreement to find out what they are comfortable with, so they will apply the burn tax without loss for them.

The Terra v1 governance community (which includes validators) must decide the appropriate trusted distribution path for the code for these two proposals.  This proposes the following code, the following distribution path, as well as a preventative security measure.

Minus any minor adjustments to blockheight to meet agreements stated in proposal 4095, or any minor adjustments required for due diligence review, rework, or testing on the part of an independent reviewer:

The code being proposed (minus any minor adjustments) can be seen below:
    · cosmos-sdk:

    · classic-docs: 
        · https://github.com/terra-rebels/classic-docs/pull/1

It is proposed that TFL either develop a novel solution or support the proposed implementation of proposal 3568 and 4095:
    · If TFL does not provide any communication, and does not merge, build, and distribute the code in support of 3568 and 4095 in 10 business days from the time this proposal may pass governance
Else It is proposed that,
    · v0.5.21 code will be distributed to validators from the following repository, https://github.com/terra-rebels/classic-core/ and the build instructions will be provided in this document source for validators, including support contact information as seen here:
        · https://github.com/terra-rebels/classic-mainnet/tree/master/columbus-5-v21

This proposes that code added for 4095, which although meets the essence of 4095, and provides for preventative security be approved:
     · That no validator should achieve more than 20% of the voting power for an indefinite period until community governance decides otherwise

We can't tax our way out of this problem. Right now, LUNC is a generic Cosmos chain with a lot of users. Serious dapp devs, who would normally be naturally incentivized to build dapps around such a large, passionate user base, will not consider building on the Terra Classic ecosystem if every user interaction faces a 1.2% tax.

In terms of the LUNC market itself, the 1.2% burn tax is a huge increase in transaction costs. If you massively raise the taxes on something you will get much less of it. Liquidity for USTC and LUNC is thus likely to go down severely after the tax has been implemented. Whales will also be able to dump their LUNC before the tax increase takes effect. The result would be a massive drop in LUNC's price.

Longer term we want to incentivize economic activity to return to the Terra Classic chain, instead of staying off-chain and allowing Binance Kucoin etc to collect the vast majority of trading revenue.

If you do not feel the Spirit of Life pulsating in your being, disregard this pact. This Covenant is for those who give back to their brother what came from above.
I propose that:

1) When LUNC reaches 1 USD, everyone who can and wants to, make a donation to serious entities that help human beings with medicines, food, housing and health!

2) These new millionaires have an obligation to mark this generation for our generosity. We will be remembered as Righteous!

3) Take stock and be more positive, only then will we dissipate this black cloud that is over the EARTH. Please be positive because you will have money. Take care of your health, for it will be the engine for your success in this new path.

4) For those who want to, be innovative and enterprising, giving opportunity and rescue to addicts and people who have gone astray. There will be no shortage of money, just get organized.

I realize that at this moment, investors who are trading should choose exchanges that have an active burn rate. Now is the time to buy and sell. The only request I make is that you respect the bullish and bearish sequence, selling only when the RSI reaches above 65 points...
From this rule, trade at will, the more trading the faster we will get there!
Good time to buy is with the RSI at 38 points and sell just above 65. Use the 15 minute chart to trade short term and 1 or 4 hours for medium and 1 day for long term.

USTC

As there's no IBC, or something similar, You are not anchored to USDT or USDC like with LUNA2, you are anchored to USTC.

So people can convert their tokens and the two classic coins only with LUNC and USTC finally , there are no stablecoins.

Even the price of LUNC it’s divided by USTC. So no stability. No support price.

If USTC will survive, possibile LUNC rallying it’s slowing by UST. What is missed is to delist UST and convert all remaining UST into LUNC, draining all the remaining liquidity into LUNC.

You can’t have both, if the other one it’s not collateralised to fiat.

This proposal is to have a single community with LUNC and not having Terra Classic divided into two coins-community.","Convert all USTC into LUNC draining all liquidity into LUNC, and delist USTC.",0,DEPOSIT_PERIOD,2022-09-05 10:41:32.354000+00:00,2022-09-19 10:41:32.354000+00:00,0,0,"[{""amount"":""2212356"",""denom"":""uluna""}]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

So also with candles, when you are in the sales position, your desire is that it continues to fall so that you benefit.... do you understand the parallel....?
The opposite too, when you are long ""investing in an idea"", your desire is for it to prosper....
The question is simple....
Which way do we want to point?

2) For the destruction and extinction of what's left of us after so much stupidity.....?

this post will be a test of censorship or no of the new team who control the Terra Classic blockchain. 

To restore the confidence and the peg, a lot of Lunc should be burned (no more minting of Lunc or very little). A (non linear) tiered system of incentives should be put in place with these principles: the more you burn and the earlier you burn your Lunc, the more and the earlier you will get from a form of future reward, with a more or less favorable vesting period. I hope the stories about suicides are not true, otherwise the people who provoke this death spiral intentionaly to profit from, would get a very strong punition now or in the future (the law of the nature, KARMA) as millions of people are affected. in burning lunc, they could do a very good action by being the whale burners (and not being burned later now or later in some form of hell).

1) Regarding time: From the approval of this, the following clauses must be established, except for those with an expiration date in their item.

2) Regarding the objective: Avoid speculators and improve the financial health of the protocol with yields on deposits of a maximum of 30% of real American inflation.

3) Inverted Interest Burn: From this approval, until 12/31/2022, 10 percent of all income would be directed to automatic burn. With the current rate of 16... there would still be 6 percent left over from the 16, which represents a good advantage over American inflation.

4) As of 1/1/2023, do not exceed deposit yields of no more than 30 percent of real US inflation. Let's clean the ""henhouse"" of the foxes.

So I can propose to the community some decision-making in relation to the brokers who refuse to reach out to us, given that they may have also been the door to a past that I don't want to comment on.... What do I propose?

1) Choose exchanges that are performing trade burns. Find out before trading there. Thus, we will shift the focus to such Exchanges and consecutively their volume and profit, even burning in trades.

2) If brokers don't want to lose clients due to trading fees, it's because they don't know the strength of our community. Let them test at least half the rate for 15 days to see if they will lose market....

3) Be sure to favor Anchor by buying and holding the ANC, this will further strengthen the parity. This asset must cost externally at least 2.80.

Having said all these things, what remains is for us to continue working with whimsy and the certainty that we are on the right path. Day after day we will be getting up more and more and resuming all the features of the ecosystem.

Stop selling for them to lose strength, remember they are being sponsored by those who support the ecosystem.
If you're going to sell with scare, sell a little. They drop the price for next to nothing and we pretty much do their job in the herd....
